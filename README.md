DynamicFIleRouting using AgenticAI-OpenAISDK


**Project Name:** Dynamic File Routing

**Description:**

**Dynamic File Routing** is an advanced automation solution designed to address a critical need in data engineering: the ability to flexibly and efficiently process, validate, and route files based on evolving business requirements.

**Project Importance in Data Engineering:**

In many data engineering projects, teams must routinely handle diverse data files from multiple sources, each with unique validation, transformation, and routing needs. Manual handling of these processes is time-consuming, error-prone, and difficult to scale as requirements change.

This project solves that challenge by:

- **Automating File Workflows:**  
  The system reads a functional requirements document (Excel-based), dynamically generating and executing a tailored workflow for each file. This includes config validation, file location, schema validation, data extraction, profiling, output formatting, and destination routing.

- **Dynamic Adaptability:**  
  By indexing the requirements document, the pipeline can instantly adapt to new or changing business rules—no code changes required. This ensures the solution remains robust and future-proof as data sources and requirements evolve.

- **End-to-End Data Quality:**  
  Each step in the process is validated and logged, ensuring data integrity and traceability throughout the pipeline.

- **Scalability and Efficiency:**  
  The agent-based architecture enables high-throughput, parallel processing, reducing manual intervention and accelerating the onboarding of new data sources.

**Technical Highlights:**

- Python (async/await, Pydantic, Pandas, OpenAI API integration)
- Modular, extensible agent framework
- Automated audit logging for compliance and traceability

**Business Impact:**

- Streamlines the integration of new data sources
- Reduces operational overhead and manual errors
- Ensures compliance with business logic and data governance
